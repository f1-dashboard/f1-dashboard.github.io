# F1 Dashboard

## Report Abstract 

We introduce a specialized data visualization platform for Formula 1's 2023 qualifying sessions. It simplifies complex race data into clear visuals for teams and passionate fans. The platform focuses on driver performance using graphs for driver speeds and braking points around the track. Evaluation shows the platform effectively exposes performance gaps during qualifying laps, emphasizing speed changes and braking patterns. However, there are limitations in exploring other factors affecting speed differences, like weather conditions, tire specifics and racing lines.
